# DebateFlow
Debate Flow is an app for flowing high school LD and PF Debate rounds.

# Description
Debate Flow lets you flow your debate rounds with ease. You can flow Lincoln Douglas Debate Rounds and Public Forum Rounds.
Flow your debate rounds faster and better than ever!

*It is very important that you know how to use this app by doing some practice rounds to get familiar with it before using it in tournaments*

# How does it work?
The appication is a matrix of textboxes which expands as you flow. Both sides have different colors and you can open multiple flow sheets. It's responsive layout makes it easier to flow and allows you to flow on a much bigger area compared to Excel.
# Features

* The TextViews expand as you flow. As the TextViews expand, the document view will expand. Therefore you will be able to scroll through the flow. In my opinion, this is one of the best reasons to use this app instead of excel.
* Flexible layout/flow for Progressive LD Debate
* You can open multiple flows/sheets.
* Save flows to a folder.
